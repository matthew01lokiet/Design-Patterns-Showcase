# Facade

## Characteristics
- Provides interface for using functionalities derived from underlying complex logic, without exposing access to this logic to the outside world  
- Most probably you use this pattern without even knowing it

## Use Cases
- When client shouldn't be bothered with underlying mechanisms and it is possible to compose results of the complex logic
into reusable functionalities

### Provided Example
No example!
Picture is worth more than the thousand words (in this case `Compiler` provides exposed functionality).
